A public GraphQL API for DC Heroes and Characters.

Inspired by [SWAPI](https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql), the Star Wars GraphQL API. Aimed to be used as a tool to learn/teach GraphQL, or just to play around ü•∞.

Uses a json file as a datasource, which was manually consolidated from info found in the [official DC web site](https://www.dccomics.com/characters)

## Docs

Try out the queries and explore the schema on [the playground](https://dcheroes.herokuapp.com/).

You can query a single `character` by name.

```graphql
{
  character(name: "Superman") {
    name
    alterEgo
    occupation
    powers
  }
}
```

With the following json as a result:

```json

  "data": {
    "character": {
      "name": "Superman",
      "alterEgo": "Clark Kent, Kal-El",
      "occupation": "Reporter",
      "powers": "super strength, flight, invulnerability, super speed, heat vision, freeze breath, x-ray vision, superhuman hearing, healing factor"
    }
  }
}
```

Or you can also query a collection of `characters`, `villains`, `heroes` and `teams`. Each of those queries with an optional filter parameter that includes a `keyword` field.

Example:

```graphql
{
  characters(filter: { keyword: "reporter" }) {
    name
  }
}
```

Will produce as a result the following json:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "characters": [
      {
        "name": "Jimmy Olsen"
      },
      {
        "name": "Lois Lane"
      },
      {
        "name": "Superman"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
