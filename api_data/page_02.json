However, there is another denizen of Gotham that knows how to use fear to his advantage. One that turns Batman\u0027s own weapon against him and revels in terror and dread: the Scarecrow.\u003Cspan style=\u0022letter-spacing: 0.03em;\u0022\u003E\u00a0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a young child, Jonathan Crane was subjected to sick and twisted experiments on fear conducted by his own father. Emotionally scarred and mentally unstable from the ordeal, Crane spent his childhood living in fear until he made an important realization\u2014if he could control fear, it would never again control him. Over time, this interest in fear become an obsession. Graduating from college with a doctorate in psychology and specialty in phobias, Jonathan began experimenting on others, subjecting them to a hallucinogenic fear toxin he developed that brought out their worst nightmares. Although Batman has developed a number of remedies to counteract these toxins, Crane is constantly improving upon his formula, creating more potent and deadlier versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Scarecrow constantly proves to be a dangerous threat to the Dark Knight not due to physical strength, but to the emotional and psychological damage his toxins can cause. In fact, Scarecrow tends to shy away from physical confrontations and instead lets his victims fall prey to their own waking nightmares. A doctor of the deadliest caliber, the Scarecrow\u0027s horrific acts don\u0027t stem from a villainous desire for power or money, but from an unbreakable urge to learn and hone his craft\u2014mastery over fear itself.\u003C/p\u003E"

However, as he learned more about the Flash, Eobard discovered how his own life was linked to his hero\u2019s: He was destined to become one of Barry Allen\u2019s greatest villains, a revelation that led Eobard to grow unhinged. When he eventually replicated the chemical accident that granted the Flash super speed, Eobard took on a new identity\u2014that of the Reverse-Flash, a wicked subversion of everything the Flash stands for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted with powers and abilities similar to that of the Flash, the Reverse-Flash is unwavering in his determination to oppose and destroy all that\u2019s important to the Flash. His ability to travel through time allows him to attack the Flash at almost any point throughout history. However, he is unable to ever kill the Flash\u2014for the Reverse-Flash would not exist if he killed his own inspiration. Instead, he does everything in his power to torment and torture the hero, an ominous visitor from a future the Flash never could\u2019ve envisioned.\u003C/p\u003E\\n\\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/Char_Thumb_ReverseFlash_5c53a1ac28b1d9.65207546.jpg\\n\\nreverse-flash\u0022,\u0022im_domain_access\u0022:[6],\u0022_version_\u0022:1659663777438629888,\u0022timestamp\u0022:\u00222020-02-27T04:45:17.83Z\u0022,\u0022score\u0022:1.0},{\u0022id\u0022:\u0022dc_base_index-272536\u0022,\u0022index_id\u0022:\u0022dc_base_index\u0022,\u0022item_id\u0022:\u0022272536\u0022,\u0022is_author\u0022:1321,\u0022tm_body$summary\u0022:[\u0022\u0022],\u0022spell\u0022:[\u0022\u0022,\u0022\u003Cp\u003EThe multiverse would be a much less lively place without the hijinks and shenanigans of the former Dr. Harleen Quinzel, the one and only Clown Princess of Crime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes love can make people do crazy things.

This creature, the Ultimate, had no purpose except destruction, and made his way across other planets before finally being defeated. Buried on the primitive planet Earth, he stirred awake after many centuries and unleashed death, earning himself the name Doomsday. The monster was finally stopped by Superman, who seemingly lost his own life in the process.
