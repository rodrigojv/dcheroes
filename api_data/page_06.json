He\u00a0furthered his education, then turned to teaching so he could help young people realize their own potential as he had. But gang violence and criminals kept threatening his community and his students, which is when Jefferson Pierce decided to no longer hide from the metahuman abilities he had been born with and started fighting evil as Black Lightning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile some vigilantes just want to stop crime or punish criminals, Black Lightning tries to help communities become stronger.

Mary and her brother\u00a0were orphaned as young children, and she ended up in the care of the wealthy Bromfield family. Years later, once Billy was already the heroic Captain Marvel (now known as Shazam), he finally met Mary at a contest being held at the radio station where he worked, WHIZ Radio. Not long after, Mary was kidnapped for ransom money, and was saved by Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. Wondering if she could access the powers of the wizard Shazam like her brother, she uttered the magic words, and she too transformed into a\u00a0superhero\u00a0and started\u00a0adventuring as part of the Marvel Family.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: 0.39px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ci\u003EFor more on Mary Marvel\u0027s history,\u00a0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/mary-marvel/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit her\u00a0page on DCUniverse.com\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"

Although fiercely strong, Mr. Tawny was not savage, and liked to wear tweed suits and compose himself like a refined gentleman. When he arrived in America, Billy Batson helped him find a job as a museum guide, and the pair had many adventures together... In post-Crisis on Infinite Earths continuity, Tawky Tawny began as a stuffed doll, which was given life by the demonic Lord Satanus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Tawky Tawny\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/tawky-tawny/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"

At the moment of this creation, the cosmic entity who would be known as the Monitor was born on the moon of Oa. At the same moment, the Monitor\u0027s twisted twin, the Anti-Monitor, was also born on the moon of Qward in the Antimatter Universe. When they discovered each other\u0027s existence, they began a war across dimensions that lasted a million years and eventually rendered them immobile for nine billion years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the Anti-Monitor finally awoke and launched a wave of antimatter, destroying universe after universe in the Multiverse, the Monitor also awoke. He gathered heroes and villains on his satellite home to fight his twisted doppelg\u00e4nger in what became known as the Crisis on Infinite Earths. But it was not a war that the Monitor would live to see the end of. During the Crisis, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Harbinger, corrupted by the dark powers of the Anti-Monitor, murdered the Monitor. But the Monitor foresaw his death and left instructions for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to harness his residual energy to save the five remaining universes of the Multiverse and create a new singular universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on the Monitor\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/monitor/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"

Those that haven\u0027t experienced this sort of\u00a0loss will never become greater than they are. Many heroes had these tragedies happen at a young age or in the early days of their careers. But for those who haven\u0027t, one man makes it his duty to break them down in order to make them better, even if he has to force their tragedy himself: Zoom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHunter Zolomon\u0027s life was riddled by brutal tragedies. As a child, he discovered his father was a serial killer who also murdered Hunter\u0027s mother after she tried to stop him. This tragedy inspired Hunter to study psychology and criminology, and to join the FBI; but a miscalculation during a case led to the death of his father-in-law. Then, things took a turn for the truly dark after an attack by Gorilla Grodd left Hunter paralyzed.
