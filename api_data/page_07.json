          "\u003Cp\u003EAs the primary agent of the Monitor, Lyla Michaels was tasked with preparing Earth\u2019s heroes for the highest stakes battle in the history of the multiverse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYoung orphan Lyla Michaels was marked for death at sea in a violent shipwreck, and as far as the world was concerned, that was her fate. In truth, Lyla was saved moments before her demise by a powerful being known as the Monitor. Locked in eternal struggle for the fate of reality with his antimatter counterpart, the Anti-Monitor, the Monitor had chosen Lyla to act as his personal agent in observing, testing and preparing the world\u2019s greatest heroes and villains for the day their battle spilled over into their universe. To accomplish this important task, the Monitor granted Lyla the powers of strength, flight, regeneration and, most importantly, duplication, allowing her to occupy multiple points at once in order to better prepare the earth for combat in the limited time before the Crisis on Infinite Earths and announce the event\u2019s coming. In this capacity, Lyla Michaels assumed the identity of the Harbinger for her grave but essential duty to announce the doom of the world should its defenders fail to defeat the Anti-Monitor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut unwittingly, Harbinger proved just as effective as an agent of the Anti-Monitor himself. When the Crisis arrived, the Anti-Monitor managed to corrupt Harbinger, leading her to betray the Monitor and bring about his death by her own hands. Mad with grief over what she had done, Harbinger shook free of the Anti-Monitor\u2019s influence and used the last of her powers to save the doomed worlds of Earth-4, Earth-S and Earth-X, allowing its heroes to merge into the New Earth which arose at the end of the Crisis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Harbinger\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/harbinger/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit her page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"

But as the sole witness to the reality-changing events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Psycho-Pirate has issues of his own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original Psycho-Pirate was an underappreciated newspaper typesetter named Charles Halstead, who longed for the world to notice him. By surreptitiously printing his messages in the paper, Halstead adopted the moniker of the Psycho-Pirate for a string of crimes designed to evoke emotional reactions of greed, hate and fear. Halstead was eventually discovered and jailed by the Justice Society of America. He shared a cellmate, a gangster by the name of Roger Hayden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile swapping stories of their lives before prison, an aging Halstead told Hayden about a secret he\u2019d learned in his days as the Psycho-Pirate: the existence of a set of mystical artifacts known as the Medusa Masks, which could be used to manipulate people\u2019s emotions directly. Once Roger Hayden was free from prison, he located these masks and designed a faceplate to flip through them at will, allowing him to project whatever emotions he desired. Though he proves a more formidable foe than his predecessor, Hayden was also soundly defeated in multiple rows with the Justice Society, even when teaming up with the Ultra-Humanite\u2019s Secret Society of Super-Villains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Psycho-Pirate\u2019s particular abilities came in high demand. He was approached by the Monitor, who enlisted him to use his Medusa Mask to call other essential personnel to defend the universe who may otherwise be reticent to join. But it wasn\u2019t long before Psycho-Pirate betrayed the world\u2019s defenders to join the Anti-Monitor after being promised a world of his own in the aftermath. When the Anti-Monitor fell, the Crisis was resolved and the world was remade, Psycho-Pirate remained one of the few beings who remembered the Infinite Earths\u2026a knowledge which drove him insane, committing him to a life in Arkham Asylum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Psycho-Pirate\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/psycho-pirate/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"

The product of a chance encounter with an alien race, Grodd and his people evolved past the common gorillas who lived in his portion of the African jungle and developed super intelligence, along with a wide array of other mental powers. But while the rest of his people chose to live apart from the world peacefully, Grodd only sought to conquer humanity so he could rule it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst coming into conflict with the Barry Allen version of the Flash, Grodd was a thorn in not only his side for many years, but also his successor Wally West\u0027s. Grodd also plagued the Justice League by joining forces with the likes of the Secret Society of Super-Villains, the Legion of Doom and other organizations of super criminals bent on world domination.

A fierce warrior without equal, the hero known as Hawkman has been a human being trapped in an ancient Egyptian curse of endless death and rebirth, and at other times, an alien police officer sent to Earth to help defend it. Sometimes, he\u0027s even been a combination of both.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost always at the side of his paramour\u2014the warrior woman called Hawkgirl\u2014Hawkman has defended our world from alien invaders and mystical threats alike, first as a member of the Justice Society of America, where he fought against the Axis powers, and later as a member of the Justice League, where he earned the respect of Earth\u0027s greatest heroes like Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. Although there are very few characters with a history as strange and complex as Hawkman\u0027s, whether it\u2019s Carter Hall or Katar Hol beneath the mask, Hawkman is one of the DC Universe\u0027s greatest heroic icons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Hawkman\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/hawkman/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"

In most versions of his history, Olsen was present when Superman made his public debut and has been friends with both the Man of Steel and his alter ego Clark Kent ever since.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite just being an ordinary guy, Jimmy Olsen is braver than most, and is always willing to put himself in real danger in order to get that elusive photo or get the scoop that\u2019ll land him the story of the century. Almost always forthright and true, James Olsen always has his BFF Superman\u2019s back, even if it\u2019s Superman who winds up needing to watch Jimmy\u2019s back most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Jimmy Olsen\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/jimmy-olsen/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"

In a city overrun with larger-than-life criminals, the always-laughing villain stands alone. A complete psychopath with no moral compass whatsoever, the Joker, whose real name and identity remain completely unknown, is characterized by his chalk-white skin, green hair and a permanent rictus grin stretched across his face. But there isn\u2019t a single thing funny about this particular clown, who only finds humor in the suffering of others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Joker first appeared in Gotham City around the same time that the Batman arrived on the scene, and since their very first confrontation, the Clown Prince of Crime has been the Dark Knight\u2019s most formidable nemesis. While Batman represents justice and order, the Joker is his complete opposite, seeing himself as an agent of chaos, the living embodiment of the cruel randomness of fate. The Joker\u2019s psychosis causes his personality to shift between goofy prankster and mass murderer on a dime, making it impossible to predict his next move. It\u2019s this unpredictability that really makes him such a dangerous opponent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECertainly, no villain has managed to inflict as much pain and suffering on Batman as the Joker, who has on more than one occasion brought death to Bruce Wayne\u2019s extended family.

First introduced as Crystal Frost, a former student of Professor Martin Stein, she was an adversary for Firestorm until her death. Shortly thereafter, her friend Dr. Louise Lincoln replicated the experiment that gave Crystal her powers and became the second Killer Frost. With a vendetta against Firestorm, she would fight the nuclear hero for years, on her own and as a member of the Suicide Squad and Injustice League.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe third and current Killer Frost is Dr. Caitlin Snow, a scientist at S.T.A.R.

Since then, Snow has found herself on both the Suicide Squad and the Justice League of America, and demonstrated a desire and willingness to be more than the villainous legacy she\u2019s inherited.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Killer Frost\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/killer-frost/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit her page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"

There\u2019s nothing in the galaxy that Lobo loves more than his pet dolphins, a good fight, the ladies and getting drunk in some intergalactic dive bar. Probably all in that order.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the years, Lobo has fought on the side of both the good guys and the bad, pretty much just drifting towards whoever pays him the most to get the job done, or which side promises him the better, bloodier fight.

He shared a cellmate, a gangster by the name of Roger Hayden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile swapping stories of their lives before prison, an aging Halstead told Hayden about a secret he\u2019d learned in his days as the Psycho-Pirate: the existence of a set of mystical artifacts known as the Medusa Masks, which could be used to manipulate people\u2019s emotions directly. Once Roger Hayden was free from prison, he located these masks and designed a faceplate to flip through them at will, allowing him to project whatever emotions he desired. Though he proves a more formidable foe than his predecessor, Hayden was also soundly defeated in multiple rows with the Justice Society, even when teaming up with the Ultra-Humanite\u2019s Secret Society of Super-Villains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Psycho-Pirate\u2019s particular abilities came in high demand. He was approached by the Monitor, who enlisted him to use his Medusa Mask to call other essential personnel to defend the universe who may otherwise be reticent to join. But it wasn\u2019t long before Psycho-Pirate betrayed the world\u2019s defenders to join the Anti-Monitor after being promised a world of his own in the aftermath. When the Anti-Monitor fell, the Crisis was resolved and the world was remade, Psycho-Pirate remained one of the few beings who remembered the Infinite Earths\u2026a knowledge which drove him insane, committing him to a life in Arkham Asylum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Psycho-Pirate\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\\\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/psycho-pirate/\\\u0022 target=\\\u0022_blank\\\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\\n\\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/Char_Thumb_PsychoPirate__5e18e3e0e0ff24.81890010.jpg\\n\\npsycho-pirate\u0022,\u0022im_domain_access\u0022:[6],\u0022_version_\u0022:1659688304068526080,\u0022timestamp\u0022:\u00222020-02-27T11:15:08.78Z\u0022,\u0022score\u0022:1.0},{\u0022id\u0022:\u0022dc_base_index-450477\u0022,\u0022index_id\u0022:\u0022dc_base_index\u0022,\u0022item_id\u0022:\u0022450477\u0022,\u0022is_author\u0022:1321,\u0022tm_body$summary\u0022:[\u0022\u0022],\u0022spell\u0022:[\u0022\u0022,\u0022\u003Cp\u003ETrained from birth as the ultimate killing machine, Cassandra Cain found a new life as the fourth Batgirl and, eventually, Orphan, a cherished part of the Batman family.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo one in the Batman Family had an easy childhood, but Cassandra Cain may have had the worst.

To accomplish this important task, the Monitor granted Lyla the powers of strength, flight, regeneration and, most importantly, duplication, allowing her to occupy multiple points at once in order to better prepare the earth for combat in the limited time before the Crisis on Infinite Earths and announce the event\u2019s coming. In this capacity, Lyla Michaels assumed the identity of the Harbinger for her grave but essential duty to announce the doom of the world should its defenders fail to defeat the Anti-Monitor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut unwittingly, Harbinger proved just as effective as an agent of the Anti-Monitor himself. When the Crisis arrived, the Anti-Monitor managed to corrupt Harbinger, leading her to betray the Monitor and bring about his death by her own hands. Mad with grief over what she had done, Harbinger shook free of the Anti-Monitor\u2019s influence and used the last of her powers to save the doomed worlds of Earth-4, Earth-S and Earth-X, allowing its heroes to merge into the New Earth which arose at the end of the Crisis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Harbinger\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/harbinger/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit her page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/Char_Thumb_Harbinger__5e18dc16c7a8f1.15330471.jpg\n\nharbinger",

Born to a life of wealth and privilege, Oliver Queen took it all for granted until tragedy struck at sea, leaving him alone on a deserted island. There, Queen had to dig deep to find out if he had the inner fortitude to survive. While stranded on this island, Oliver honed his already formidable archery skills into becoming the greatest archer ever known.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen he finally returned to civilization, he embarked on a career as an urban vigilante, attempting to rid the streets of his hometown of Seattle, and also Star City, from crime and corruption with nothing but a bow and arrow.

Almost always forthright and true, James Olsen always has his BFF Superman\u2019s back, even if it\u2019s Superman who winds up needing to watch Jimmy\u2019s back most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Jimmy Olsen\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/jimmy-olsen/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/default_images/DC_placeholder_comic-active_573b3c133ef580.76442500.jpg\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/Char_Thumb_JimmyOlsen_5c4fa2975d66b2.61779975.jpg\n\njimmy olsen",

Most are generally human. But one stands apart\u2014the massive freak of nature known as Killer Croc. Born as Waylon Jones, Croc has a rare genetic condition which gives him a crocodilian appearance. Raised by an abusive aunt who mocked his deformity, he eventually ran away and joined the circus, becoming a sideshow carnival attraction, where patrons could come and gawk at the freakish strongman called \u0022Killer Croc.\u0022 Croc eventually departed for Gotham City, where he began a life of crime\u2014one which brought him into regular conflict with the Dark Knight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough he began as just a man with crocodile-like skin, over the years, Killer Croc\u0027s appearance has grown more and more inhuman. Croc now has a more bestial form, complete with a truly reptilian head, razor sharp claws and teeth, and a tail. His animal nature has made him a formidable foe, but his limited intellect has kept him from ever truly achieving his true potential. Nevertheless, Croc\u2019s brute strength and killer instincts have made him an ever-present thorn in Batman\u2019s side, who must be ever vigilant in case the deadly Croc once again emerges from the sewers below to wreak havoc on Gotham City.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Killer Croc\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/killer-croc/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/default_images/DC_placeholder_comic-active_573b3c133ef580.76442500.jpg\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/Char_Thumb_KillerCroc_5eb5b4acdd1260.22159867.jpg\n\nkiller croc",

That\u2019s because the word \u201cLobo\u201d in this instance translates into \u201che who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it\u201d in the ancient Khund dialect.
