          "\u003Cp\u003ELois Lane\u0027s career spans more than eight decades\u2014as the world\u0027s most celebrated journalist, the mother of Superboy and the wife of Superman.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey say behind every great man is an equally great woman. So, it\u2019s fitting that Superman, the World\u2019s Greatest Super Hero, has had the support of Lois Lane since he first appeared way back in 1938. But as the world\u2019s most famous news reporter, Lois is every bit a hero in her own right. From her earliest years as a love interest and damsel-in-distress for the Man of Steel through her evolution into a fearless social crusader, Lois has become synonymous with everything Superman himself stands for: truth, justice, and the American way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for Metropolis\u2019s Daily Planet, Lois takes her work uncovering the truth very seriously. So seriously, in fact, that it\u2019s had the unfortunate side effect of putting her in danger more than a few times. Luckily, even before they were romantically involved, Superman has always been there to catch her when she falls.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the years, Lois has worn many hats besides that of journalist. She\u0027s been a wife and mother, a costumed vigilante, a ghostwriter and a political activist, making her a Superwoman in fact as well as name.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Lois Lane\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/lois-lane/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit her page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"

She, along with several women, who were also reincarnated souls whose lives were cut short by man\u0027s hatred, formed the noble Amazon tribe in ancient times. The jealous war god Ares influenced the demigod Heracles into seducing Hippolyta, and then enslaving her after he\u0027d gained her trust. Freed by the goddess Athena, Hippolyta liberated her Amazon sisters and defeated Heracles\u0027 soldiers.

Reluctantly, Queen Hippolyta allowed her daughter Diana to leave Themyscira and become Wonder Woman, a fact which has caused her constant worry. While once Hippolyta took her daughter\u0027s place as Wonder Woman and travelled back in time to have adventures with the Justice Society, today, Queen Hippolyta remains on Themyscira, ruling over its people and separated from her daughter Diana, who can never return.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Hippolyta\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/hippolyta/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit her page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"

A boisterous young woman with a lust for life and an appetite for sweets rivaled only by her one for boys, in the Golden Age, Etta Candy was the sheltered Wonder Woman\u2019s guide to many of the Earthly pleasures which man\u2019s world had to offer\u2014and, as head of the always lively Beeta Lambda sorority at Holliday College, Diana\u2019s window into the nature of sisterhood outside of Paradise Island as well. Before long, Etta Candy was fast friends with not only Diana, but her alter ego Wonder Woman, as well. Whenever the Amazon Princess needed a hand, Etta Candy and her \u201cHolliday Girls\u201d were always on the way to help with a \u201cWOO!

Etta Candy herself was reinvented as Colonel Steve Trevor\u2019s personal aide, love interest, and eventually his wife.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing \u003Cem\u003EFlashpoint\u003C/em\u003E, Etta Candy was reinvented once again. Her marriage to Steve Trevor was undone, and she served as a field commander at the metahuman defense agency known as A.R.G.U.S. Etta was once more one of the first friends Diana had made in the modern world. But this time, Commander Candy\u2019s feelings leaned towards another mutual friend of Wonder Woman\u2019s: the brainy, adventurous archaeologist Barbara Ann Minerva. But while Barbara reciprocated Etta\u2019s feelings, their relationship was doomed by Dr. Minerva\u2019s transformation into Wonder Woman\u2019s arch-enemy, the Cheetah.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Etta Candy\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/etta-candy/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit her page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"

A fierce warrior empowered by the mythical Girdle of Gaea, she has used her enhanced strength and fighting prowess to train her fellow Amazons as warriors, capable of facing any adversity that comes their way. But Antiope is known for more than just her skill in battle. Unafraid to voice her frustration with Themyscira\u2019s traditions, her brazenness has put her in direct conflict with her sisters more than once, and even brought her to denounce the gods themselves in order to fight for what she believes is right. Following one such denouncement, Antiope left the island and fell in love with Theseus, son of Hercules. Together, they settled into what would eventually become Bana-Mighdall, home of a splinter group of Amazons that would include the warrior Artemis. Though she did not always agree with the laws of her people, Antiope\u2019s spirit served as inspiration for Hippolyta\u2019s daughter, Diana, on her journey to becoming Wonder Woman.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Antiope\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/antiope/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit her page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"

Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super Hero. He\u0027s developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he\u0027s assembled teams of his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman, Incorporated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne\u2019s double life affords him the comfort of a life without financial worry, a loyal butler-turned-guardian and the perfect base of operations in the ancient network of caves beneath his family\u2019s sprawling estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape and pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, skies and rooftops of Gotham City.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Batman\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/batman/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"

Each of them redefined the word \u0022hero.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mysterious power known as the Speed Force is an energy field that has, over the centuries, granted incredible powers of velocity to certain heroes. The most famous of these\u00a0is the Flash, also known as the Fastest Man Alive. Ever since the days of World War II, there has been a man clad in red who can run at impossible speeds, using his power to save lives and defend those who cannot defend themselves. All between the ticks of a second.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the 1940s, college student Jay Garrick acquired his super-speed abilities in a random lab accident and became the first DC Super Hero to go by the name the Flash. Years later, Jay was succeeded by police scientist Barry Allen, until Barry\u2019s former kid partner Wally West took up the mantle at a time when Barry was considered dead. But, when Barry returned, he became the Flash once again. All three generations of speedsters have been cornerstone members of both the Justice Society and Justice League.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Flash has mastery over not just speed, but time itself, and\u00a0he has often used his powers to travel though different eras\u00a0and even into other dimensions. Although the Flash has not always been fast enough to outrun personal tragedy when it has come for him, he always does his best to prevent the same from happening to the people of Central City and Keystone City. In so doing, he\u0027s earned himself a spot among the greatest Super Heroes the DC Universe has ever known.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-weight: 700;\u0022\u003EFor more on the Flash\u0027s history,\u00a0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/flash/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"

Keeping the name Giganta, she embarked on a career as a super-villain, fighting with Wonder Woman several times, both alone and with a variety of different villain teams.

She, along with several women, who were also reincarnated souls whose lives were cut short by man\u0027s hatred, formed the noble Amazon tribe in ancient times. The jealous war god Ares influenced the demigod Heracles into seducing Hippolyta, and then enslaving her after he\u0027d gained her trust. Freed by the goddess Athena, Hippolyta liberated her Amazon sisters and defeated Heracles\u0027 soldiers. As atonement for being deceived, she and her sisters were exiled to the island of Themyscira, where they would remain isolated from mankind and immortal as long as they remained there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEventually, Hippolyta was gifted with a daughter, whom she named Diana. Blessed with powers from the gods themselves, it is unclear if Diana was created when Hippolyta crafted a child made of clay which was gifted with life, or if Diana was born from an affair between herself and Zeus, as there are conflicting accounts to Diana\u2019s creation. Reluctantly, Queen Hippolyta allowed her daughter Diana to leave Themyscira and become Wonder Woman, a fact which has caused her constant worry. While once Hippolyta took her daughter\u0027s place as Wonder Woman and travelled back in time to have adventures with the Justice Society, today, Queen Hippolyta remains on Themyscira, ruling over its people and separated from her daughter Diana, who can never return.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Hippolyta\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/hippolyta/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit her page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/default_images/DC_placeholder_comic-active_573b3c133ef580.76442500.jpg\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/Char_Thumb_Hippolyta_5ed1a85b06f5b9.66401558.jpg\n\nhippolyta",

Take the case of the diminutive psionic super-villain Doctor Psycho.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWonder Woman\u2019s longtime enemy Edgar Cizko began his criminal career as a man wrongfully imprisoned due to a frame-up by a romantic rival named Ben Bradley. The experience awakened in Cizko latent powers of illusion and hypnosis. He used his abilities to bend people (particularly women, whom he resented) to his will, and often fought the Amazon Princess.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the history-altering events of 1985\u2019s \u003Cem\u003ECrisis on Infinite Earths, \u003C/em\u003EEdgar Cizko was reintroduced as a psychologist obsessed with telepathy, leading some to mockingly call him \u201cDr. Psycho.\u201d But thanks to his research, he gained a multitude of psionic powers. He possessed powers not only of telepathy, but mind control, telekinesis, astral projection and psi energy (or ectokinesis) that he could use to create and animate constructs. Unfortunately, Cizko was a sadist who hated women and enjoyed terrifying and torturing people to further his research into the human mind\u2026and sometimes simply for enjoyment. More than once, he\u2019s helped other villains attack or manipulate Earth\u2019s heroes. Upon occasion, he has joined the Secret Society of Super-Villains (a.k.a. the Society).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Doctor Psycho\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/dr-psycho/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/default_images/DC_placeholder_comic-active_573b3c133ef580.76442500.jpg\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/Char_Thumb_DoctorPsycho_5eab3b86b6da84.62690124.jpg\n\ndoctor psycho",
