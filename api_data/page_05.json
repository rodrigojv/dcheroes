Barda relished fighting and enjoyed besting anyone that challenged her. Her sheer power and unparalleled skills in combat quickly made her the most feared Apokoliptian warrior of all time\u2014an incredible feat to accomplish on a world that bred the most terrifying, cruel and malicious fighters in the Multiverse. Barda\u0027s abilities and take-charge attitude even allowed her to become the leader of the Female Furies, a ferocious and powerful group of warriors who served as the personal guard to Apokolips\u0027s tyrannical ruler, Darkseid. Barda served Darkseid for many years\u2014until she met Mister Miracle. The two fell in love and Barda began questioning Darkseid\u2019s cruelty and totalitarian philosophy.

Whereas Mister Miracle is more peaceful and kind, Barda loves to fight and relishes battle. She\u0027s the brawn to his brain, and as the more powerful of the two, tends to be very protective of him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a New God, Barda possesses immense levels of enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina and more. Barda is also a master of multiple forms of combat and an expert swordswoman, capable of fighting even Wonder Woman to a stand-still. Her height alone makes her one of the tallest and most intimidating heroes in the universe. Along with her physical capabilities, Barda wears Apokoliptian armor that enhances her impressive abilities and wields the Mega-Rod, which may look small but packs a punch that could level mountains. As a high-tech weapon, the Mega-Rod fires powerful concussive bolts, increases gravitational forces and allows Barda to instantaneously teleport herself and others great distances.\u003C/p\u003E"

However, despite the brutality and violence inflicted upon him, his will never broke and he never gave up hope. He dreamed of escape. But to escape the unescapable, he would need a miracle\u2014so he became Mister Miracle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to stop the destructive and long-waged war between New Genesis and Apokolips, the benevolent Highfather agreed to a gesture of peace: he would exchange sons with Darkseid, effectively condemning his child to the hells of Apokolips. Darkseid turned Scott over to Granny Goodness\u0027s \u0022Orphanage,\u0022 where he was subjected to countless horrors and torture in an effort to destroy the goodness inside him, but Scott refused to surrender his innocence. Never physically powerful, Scott instead began training his mind\u2014mentally distancing himself from the pain and sharpening his reason, logic and problem-solving abilities\u2014turning him into an unparalleled and cunning thinker. When he finally made his escape, he succeeded through brain and not brawn, leaving behind the terror of Apokolips for life on Earth as the super hero Mister Miracle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMister Miracle shares a close and romantic relationship with his fellow New God Big Barda. The two met on Apokolips and quickly fell in love, despite their contrasting personalities. While Barda loves to fight and relishes battle, Scott is more peaceful and kind and simply wants to fit in and lead a normal life, much to Barda\u0027s chagrin. Their contrasting personalities but deep love for one another gives them one of the most unique relationships in the DC Universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike all New Gods, Mister Miracle possesses beyond superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina and more.

He also utilizes personally modified Aero Disks that allow him to fly at speeds of over 200 mph and cling to walls and ceilings. Incredible intelligent and resourceful, Mister Miracle is most impressively known as the world\u0027s greatest escape artist, with the ability to escape from literally anything\u2014even death.\u003C/p\u003E"

However, despite the brutality and violence inflicted upon him, his will never broke and he never gave up hope. He dreamed of escape. But to escape the unescapable, he would need a miracle\u2014so he became Mister Miracle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to stop the destructive and long-waged war between New Genesis and Apokolips, the benevolent Highfather agreed to a gesture of peace: he would exchange sons with Darkseid, effectively condemning his child to the hells of Apokolips. Darkseid turned Scott over to Granny Goodness\u0027s \\\u0022Orphanage,\\\u0022 where he was subjected to countless horrors and torture in an effort to destroy the goodness inside him, but Scott refused to surrender his innocence. Never physically powerful, Scott instead began training his mind\u2014mentally distancing himself from the pain and sharpening his reason, logic and problem-solving abilities\u2014turning him into an unparalleled and cunning thinker. When he finally made his escape, he succeeded through brain and not brawn, leaving behind the terror of Apokolips for life on Earth as the super hero Mister Miracle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMister Miracle shares a close and romantic relationship with his fellow New God Big Barda. The two met on Apokolips and quickly fell in love, despite their contrasting personalities. While Barda loves to fight and relishes battle, Scott is more peaceful and kind and simply wants to fit in and lead a normal life, much to Barda\u0027s chagrin. Their contrasting personalities but deep love for one another gives them one of the most unique relationships in the DC Universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike all New Gods, Mister Miracle possesses beyond superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina and more. Along with his natural gifts, Mister Miracle carries a number of weapons and advanced Apokoliptian technology, including a Mother Box that can transfer energy, sense danger and life, create force fields, project shock-waves and open boom tubes for travel. He also utilizes personally modified Aero Disks that allow him to fly at speeds of over 200 mph and cling to walls and ceilings.

Displaying a vast array of powers that can give even Superman a run for his money, the Martian Manhunter was a founding member of the Justice League of America, and has been a member of almost every incarnation of the League ever since.

For some, that guilt becomes a burden and a gnawing presence\u2014one that can rip a person in two and drive them to seek vengeance. That vengeance becomes their very existence, consuming them and motivating their every move. People like this have likely suffered unimaginable loss and they feel responsible. Or they may be suffering from the curse of El Diablo\u2026\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen gang leader Chato Santana was left severely wounded after being betrayed by his second-in-command, he found himself sharing a hospital room with the comatose gunslinger Lazarus Lane. The nearly dead Santana traveled to the spirit world, where Lane passed the El Diablo curse he had been suffering from on to him. It wasn\u2019t a gift. The El Diablo curse is rooted in revenge and punishment. It drives the afflicted to seek right for any wrongs that have been done, regardless of the cost. It bestows its host with a variety of abilities, most notably pyrokinesis and extreme resistance to injury, as well as supernatural skills such as seeing a person\u2019s sins written on their soul and communicating with spirits in the great beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChato used his newfound pyrokinesis when going after a rival gang. He set the gang\u2019s home ablaze and accidentally killed an innocent woman and children in the process. Remorseful over his crime, Chato didn\u2019t resist arrest and found himself calling Belle Reve Penitentiary home. Proving his loyalty under extreme duress, he was soon inducted into the Suicide Squad. Though his repentant attitude often runs counter to the devil-may-care approach of his teammates, Chato\u2019s abilities as El Diablo have helped the Squad\u2019s success rate tremendously.\u003C/p\u003E\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/ThumbChar_192x291_ElDiablo_alt_57a3b32716a961.39900850.jpg\n\nel diablo",

However, despite the brutality and violence inflicted upon him, his will never broke and he never gave up hope. He dreamed of escape. But to escape the unescapable, he would need a miracle\u2014so he became Mister Miracle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to stop the destructive and long-waged war between New Genesis and Apokolips, the benevolent Highfather agreed to a gesture of peace: he would exchange sons with Darkseid, effectively condemning his child to the hells of Apokolips. Darkseid turned Scott over to Granny Goodness\u0027s \u0022Orphanage,\u0022 where he was subjected to countless horrors and torture in an effort to destroy the goodness inside him, but Scott refused to surrender his innocence. Never physically powerful, Scott instead began training his mind\u2014mentally distancing himself from the pain and sharpening his reason, logic and problem-solving abilities\u2014turning him into an unparalleled and cunning thinker. When he finally made his escape, he succeeded through brain and not brawn, leaving behind the terror of Apokolips for life on Earth as the super hero Mister Miracle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMister Miracle shares a close and romantic relationship with his fellow New God Big Barda. The two met on Apokolips and quickly fell in love, despite their contrasting personalities. While Barda loves to fight and relishes battle, Scott is more peaceful and kind and simply wants to fit in and lead a normal life, much to Barda\u0027s chagrin. Their contrasting personalities but deep love for one another gives them one of the most unique relationships in the DC Universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike all New Gods, Mister Miracle possesses beyond superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina and more. Along with his natural gifts, Mister Miracle carries a number of weapons and advanced Apokoliptian technology, including a Mother Box that can transfer energy, sense danger and life, create force fields, project shock-waves and open boom tubes for travel. He also utilizes personally modified Aero Disks that allow him to fly at speeds of over 200 mph and cling to walls and ceilings.
