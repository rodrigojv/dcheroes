On Earth-30, Kal-L\u0027s arrival on earth was delayed by mere hours and instead of landing upon the fields of Kansas, the Kryptonian\u0027s rocket crashed on a Russian collective farm. Raised on Soviet soil, Kal-L became a Communist Superman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe presence of Superman and his extraordinary abilities meant Russia was revered as the world\u0027s only superpower. However, the United States did not stand idly by. American leaders scrambled to put the country on equal footing, and the genius Lex Luthor was all too ready to provide assistance. He flexed his mental muscles and created Bizarro, using that Superman clone along with Green Lantern as American super-weapons\u00a0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuthor also enlisted the assistance of Batman. The caped hero became a painful thorn in the sides of Russian authorities as he embraced his role as a terrorist freedom fighter. What began as a personal vendetta against a member of the Joseph Stalin\u0027s police force became something bigger as Batman executed acts of insurgency against Superman\u0027s regime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u2019s in the past. Now, after decades of strife and struggle between Russia and the United States, the citizens of Earth-30 are prospering. Superman is presumed dead and the world thrives under leadership from the Luthor family.\u003C/p\u003E"

Under a now elderly Bruce Wayne\u2019s guidance, Terry has been joined by Green Lantern, Superman, Warhawk, Aquagirl, Big Barda, Micron and others to form a team known as Justice League Beyond. Together this team, like the Justice League that preceded it, battles the evil that threatens this world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth-12 serves as a reminder that the future is often a sad reminder that problems and shortcomings may never be solved, and in fact sometimes worsen. However, it can also be a source of comfort and hope\u2014an advanced world where heroes like Terry and the Justice League Beyond continue our quest for truth, justice and a better tomorrow. In short, a future that, while imperfect, is still looking bright!\u003C/p\u003E"

One of these was Kamandi, the so-called Last Boy on Earth. Kamadi lives a rugged life of adventure and exploration.

Enter the\u00a0lonely, bipolar Dr. Will Tornado, a mechanical genius with a vision. Tornado focused his efforts on engineering his own super heroes from the ground up, and decided to base them on the comic books he had read and cherished as a kid. The results are a Justice League as powerful as all the others\u2014only robots.

Tornado appropriately chose Nth Metal from which to construct Earth-44\u0027s Hawkman, inspired by his counterpart\u2019s native planet, Thanagar. Elongated Man is here composed of Tin, giving him that much-needed malleable quality, while\u00a0the slow and bulky Lead recalls the Justice League\u0027s Green Arrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETogether, they keep the people of their planet safe, a truly shining example of justice, heroism and teamwork.\u003C/p\u003E\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/ThumbChar_192x291_Earth44_550c77d8949478.45385556.jpg\n\nearth-44",

Corporate corruption. The problems facing the people of Earth-33 are serious and abundant\u2014something that\u2019s made all the more terrifying by its complete lack of super heroes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut before you write this world off as doomed, know this. Over the past 2,000 years, the people of Earth-33 have thrived. What they lack in power, they make up for in imagination and ingenuity. If they\u2019ve been deprived of the good fortune of other worlds, worlds that have been graced by benevolent alien protectors, fortuitous lightning strikes and a powerful undercurrent of magic, Earth-33 has made up for it in dreams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese dreams have taken many forms, but most notable of all may be the visual storytelling medium we call comic books. In it, we\u2019ve dreamed of super men who could fly, billionaires who fight crime and Amazon warriors who wield truth-bringing lassos\u2014heroes who have filled up a whole Multiverse of worlds. So when that Multiverse is in danger, it only makes sense that we dream up one more: Ultra Comics, a super hero who exists on Earth-33 the only way he can, in the form of the very medium that birthed them. Will Ultra Comics be enough to keep the Multiverse from falling? Only time will tell. But it\u2019s clear that the lives of millions of super heroes throughout the universe may now be dependent on the most unlikely of saviors:\u00a0The only world in the Multiverse without them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/ThumbChar_192x291_earth33_553ecf466fea08.36198984.jpg\n\nearth-33",
