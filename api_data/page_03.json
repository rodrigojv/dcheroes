          "\u003Cp\u003EA former Batman villain and a founding member of the Suicide Squad, Floyd Lawton is the ultimate killer for hire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the deadliest assassins in the DC Universe, Floyd Lawton, a.k.a. Deadshot, has no real superhuman abilities, unless you count his uncannily accurate aim and affection for firearms of all types. Boasting that he never misses a shot, Lawton became infamous as a deadly marksman and gun-for-hire, a reputation that earned him no shortage of trouble with both the law and the superhero community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring one of his prison stays, Lawton was recruited by Amanda Waller to join the covert Task Force X, otherwise known as the Suicide Squad, in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. A thrill-seeker with a self-destructive personality, Lawton readily accepted the terms and went on to become one of the Squad\u2019s longest-serving members.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough he\u2019s violent, dangerously unbalanced and murderous, Lawton has, over time, shown a capacity for good. He is fiercely loyal to his semi-estranged daughter, Zoe, whom he tries to support with the earnings from his missions and criminal endeavors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Deadshot\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/deadshot/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"

          "\u003Cp\u003EOswald Cobblepot. Not exactly a name designed to shake the pillars of Gotham\u2019s dark criminal underworld. Maybe it\u2019s his other name that strikes fear into the hearts of citizens both good and bad: The Penguin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a villain fueled by a pathological rage that compels him to turn his odd physique, bird-like profile and awkward waddle into a well-dressed force for fear. No one knows more about what the evil forces of Gotham are up to at any given moment than he and he uses that information to blackmail, intimidate and corrupt anyone he can, especially when it\u2019s in the service of bringing down Batman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey say you shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover, but they also say evil is as evil does. A master manipulator, the Penguin is usually surrounded by violent henchmen who do his bidding without question. But when it comes down to a face-to-face, expect him to unleash a deadly barrage from a variety of umbrella weapons and other ingenious devices\u2014often taking the form of fowl. And when all else fails, the Penguin will fight as dirty as they come, hand to hand combat doesn\u2019t ruffle his feathers at all.\u003C/p\u003E"

          "\u003Cp\u003EFrom a young age, we\u2019re taught the difference between good and evil, and for most of us, those early lessons go on to shape our entire worldview. So imagine what might happen if we were to flip the message. If we were to teach our children that evil was the way of the world. If teachers and philosophers taught their students to \u201cdo no good\u201d rather than to \u201cdo no harm.\u201d If the world leaders and heroes of our planet sought to maintain chaos and corruption rather than peace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur world would be starkly different. It would be a nightmare. It would be a place of death and devastation. It would be Earth-3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA complete opposite of Earth-0 in every way, good and evil are reversed in the ruthless nations of Earth-3. Greed, ambition and conquest are rewarded, especially when they come at the expense of others. Heroes have no place in a world like this, and so it\u2019s a collective of villains that seek to prolong and foster their Earth\u2019s way of life: Ultraman, Superwoman, Owlman, Power Ring, Johnny Quick, the Sea King, Atomica and Grid. Or as they\u2019re better known, the Crime Syndicate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet in a world where destruction is celebrated, how long will it be until all is eliminated and existence itself is wiped out? For Earth-3, that day finally arrived as the entire world was eliminated by an even larger instrument of devastation\u2014the Anti-Monitor. Now, only a few members of the Crime Syndicate remain after fleeing from their Earth to ours. One could view it as poetic justice\u2026 if Earth-3 cared about poetry.\u003C/p\u003E"

The title of Batman, taken on after Bruce Wayne\u2019s retirement by the original Robin, Dick Grayson, is eventually passed down to Wayne\u2019s\u00a0son, Bruce Wayne, Jr.\u00a0Even later, the grandson of Superman and Batman\u2014Clark Wayne\u2014develops a\u00a0futuristic\u00a0superhero identity: Knightwing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these heroes\u00a0and more\u2014including the offspring of other members of the Justice League\u2014continue to fight evil down through the generations, though there is one determined enemy that none of them seem capable of opposing: Time itself.\u003C/p\u003E"

Batman. Wonder Woman. The three most powerful and beloved super heroes the world over. To people of all nations and cultures, these three remarkable individuals inspire hope, perseverance and achievement, assuring us that we have nothing to fear from anyone looking to do harm to our world and its citizens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine, then, what might happen if they were all to fall in the same battle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany people would lose hope and drift into despair. But Jay Garrick, Alan Scott, Kendra Munoz-Saunders, Thomas Wayne, Val-Zod and many other men and women of Earth-2 saw it as a calling, rising up to form a new generation of heroes determined to pick up where the previous ones left off. It won\u2019t be easy. Not always trusted by the people of their world, these new heroes will be tested from all sides, never more so than by the beings that destroyed their predecessors in the first place\u2014the evil New Gods of Apokolips. With the fate of Earth-2 on the line, these diverse individuals must put aside their differences and stand together, succeeding where others before them have failed, freeing their world of the threats seeking its destruction. They must do this in Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman\u2019s honor\u2026 or risk befalling their fate.\u003C/p\u003E\\n\\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/ThumbChar_192x291_Earth2_5418dc9051fb41.03826031.jpg\\n\\nearth-2\u0022,\u0022im_domain_access\u0022:[6],\u0022_version_\u0022:1659674158037991424,\u0022timestamp\u0022:\u00222020-02-27T07:30:17.863Z\u0022,\u0022score\u0022:1.0},{\u0022id\u0022:\u0022dc_base_index-341681\u0022,\u0022index_id\u0022:\u0022dc_base_index\u0022,\u0022item_id\u0022:\u0022341681\u0022,\u0022is_author\u0022:18781,\u0022tm_body$summary\u0022:[\u0022\u0022],\u0022spell\u0022:[\u0022\u0022,\u0022\u003Cp\u003ERiddle us this: what cerebral criminal with an affinity for purple and green loves challenging the Dark Knight with cleverly calculated crimes and puzzling plots?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the Dark Knight\u0027s most infamous villains, Edward Nygma enjoys flaunting his intellectual superiority by conducting crimes and leaving clues for Batman to piece together.

While this habit constantly leads to the aptly named Riddler failing in his criminal endeavors, his puzzle-problem actually stems not only from his own narcissism and ego, but also from a deep-seeded psychological compulsion. Because of this, the Riddler often finds himself a resident of Arkham Asylum following his inevitable capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossessing a genius-level intellect, the Riddler creates elaborate, sometimes Rube Goldberg-esque traps, and is even willing to use innocent civilians as bait. Although not physically imposing, the Riddler\u0027s brilliance, neurosis and lack of empathy make him an incredibly dangerous foe. He cares very little\u2014if at all\u2014about the lives of those he uses in his plots and instead only sees them as disposable pawns in his continuing intellectual battle against Batman.\u003C/p\u003E\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/Char_Thumb_Riddler_5c53a3b5e018c4.92974885.jpg\n\nriddler",
