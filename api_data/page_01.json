That\u2019s an idea that has driven Mike Carter, a college football star of the 25th Century who earned the nickname \u201cBooster\u201d on the field. Even though people assured him a professional career of fame and fortune was in his future, he decided he couldn\u2019t wait and wagered on his own games. The scandal halted his dreams of professional stardom and ruined his reputation. Taking a job as a security guard in the Metropolis Space Museum, Mike saw another opportunity after studying the early age of superheroes. With future and alien technology stolen from the museum, and a time machine that was on display, he realized he could not only become a superhero himself in a past era where his criminal history was unknown, but he could also make his good deeds profitable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith his robot pal Skeets at his side, Mike time-traveled to the modern age and debuted as Booster Gold. For years now, he\u2019s fought evil alongside different versions of the Justice League and his good pal Ted Kord, the second Blue Beetle. Recently, Booster Gold has broadened his scope and acts as a protector of history itself. Though always eager to take credit for good deeds on social media or sign with a well-paying sponsor, Booster is a good guy at heart and will drop everything if he genuinely sees someone in need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Booster Gold\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/mythos/booster-gold/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"

When teenager Ronnie Raymond was caught in a nuclear accident with the brilliant Professor Martin Stein, their atoms fused together, creating a powerful metahuman who could emit deadly nuclear fire and alter inorganic matter into whatever form he could imagine. The brash teenager Ronnie had control of Firestorm\u0027s conscious mind and body, while Stein existed in the background, guiding his actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecoming the youngest member ever admitted into the ranks of the Justice League at the time, the flame-haired Nuclear Man served alongside the likes of Superman and Batman for many years, earning the respect of the old guard of heroes, while forging his own path for a new generation of heroic icons. Although he\u0027d undergo many different permutations as time went on, adding the Russian hero Pozhar to the Firestorm matrix, and later, teenager Jason Rusch, Firestorm always remained one of the Earth\u0027s most staunch defenders, not to mention one of the most powerful beings on the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFor more on Firestorm\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/firestorm/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"

Becoming Batman\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Robin is an expert fighter and astounding acrobat\u2014with the toughest example in the world to live up to. But the Boy Wonder\u2019s true strength may lie in not being Batman\u2014and providing a beacon of hope and family throughout the Dark Knight\u2019s grim crusade.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EBut as Dick matures into his own entity\u2014eventually becoming the masked crime fighter Nightwing\u2014Robin proves more than just an identity, but a mantle passed to the most worthy.

But in death, he became one of its greatest heroes. Brand performed as a trapeze artist using the stage name \u0022Deadman\u0022 due to his death-defying acts, ghostly white face paint and flamboyant costume. But during one of his performances, he was murdered in midair by a mysterious assassin known only as \u0022The Hook.\u0022 When he died, his spirit was granted the power to possess any living being by the Hindu god Rama Kushna, so that Boston could search for his killer and receive a measure of peace. Now a literal Deadman, he was both a ghost and a DC superhero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough Deadman would eventually catch his murderer, who\u0027d killed him as part of an elaborate initiation ritual to join an elite group of assassins, he continued to use his abilities to help people in the mortal world. While the majority of Earth\u0027s heroes don\u0027t know about Brand\u0027s existence as Deadman, there are a select few who do. He\u0027s worked several times with Batman, as well as more supernaturally inclined heroes like the Spectre and the Sentinels of Magic. In more recent years, he\u0027s served as a member of the Justice League Dark. Whether solo or partnered with other heroes, Deadman continues to haunt the Earth, protecting the innocent and working to balance the scales of justice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Deadman\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/deadman/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/deadman_192x291_53c587a09601f9.70066359.jpg\n\ndeadman",

The original Beetle was an archaeologist named Dan Garrett, who discovered an ancient Scarab in an old Egyptian tomb that gave him superpowers which he used to fight crime. He was succeeded by the brilliant Ted Kord, who had no powers to speak of, but carried on the Blue Beetle legacy with just his wits and his fists, along with a whole lot of gadgets and a sharp sense of humor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most recent Blue Beetle is Jaime Reyes, a teenager from El Paso, Texas who bonded with Dan Garrett\u0027s Scarab. The artifact gave him incredible alien armor which he used to defend his hometown from all manner of metahuman criminals. A Blue Beetle has been a part of the superhero community in the DC Universe in some form since 1939, serving both as a solo adventurer and as a part of teams like the Justice League and the Teen Titans, creating one of the greatest heroic legacies in the DCU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor more on Blue Beetle\u0027s history, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dcuniverse.com/mythos/blue-beetle/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evisit his page on DCUniverse.com.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\nhttp://default/sites/default/files/Char_Thumb_BlueBeetle_5c4118a71474e2.43949452.jpg\n\nblue beetle",
