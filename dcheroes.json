Faced with an entire world completely unrecognizable from the one she grew up in, she’s the ultimate new girl in school—with a planet-splitting right hook. A lonely girl with astounding might, she struggles to find her identity on her new reluctant home.<br /><br />As the most powerful teenager on the planet, the Girl of Steel possesses all of Superman’s powers—from superhuman strength, speed, and invulnerability all the way down to his flight and enhanced senses. Still learning to control her awesome powers and lacking her cousin’s self-restraint, she may even be more dangerous than the Man of Steel. Disconnected from a world she’s still struggling to comprehend, she’ll find non-stop action and violence from her first minute on this planet.</p>",

Even though people assured him a professional career of fame and fortune was in his future, he decided he couldn’t wait and wagered on his own games. The scandal halted his dreams of professional stardom and ruined his reputation. Taking a job as a security guard in the Metropolis Space Museum, Mike saw another opportunity after studying the early age of superheroes. With future and alien technology stolen from the museum, and a time machine that was on display, he realized he could not only become a superhero himself in a past era where his criminal history was unknown, but he could also make his good deeds profitable.</p><p>With his robot pal Skeets at his side, Mike time-traveled to the modern age and debuted as Booster Gold. For years now, he’s fought evil alongside different versions of the Justice League and his good pal Ted Kord, the second Blue Beetle. Recently, Booster Gold has broadened his scope and acts as a protector of history itself. Though always eager to take credit for good deeds on social media or sign with a well-paying sponsor, Booster is a good guy at heart and will drop everything if he genuinely sees someone in need.</p><p><br /><em><strong>For more on Booster Gold's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/mythos/booster-gold/\" target=\"_blank\">visit his page on DCUniverse.com.</a></strong></em></p>",

So, what do you do if you’re the Boy Wonder to one of the most recognizable super heroes in the universe and you’re looking to break out on your own?</p><p>Simple. You become Nightwing.</p><p>When his circus acrobat family was brutally murdered, Dick Grayson was taken in by billionaire and bat-friendly super hero Bruce Wayne. Bruce shared his secret life as Batman with the young boy and eventually molded him into Robin—the Dark Knight’s partner in Gotham. But as Dick grew older, playing second fiddle to the sternest hero in the Justice League began to wear on him, and eventually he struck out on his own, staying true to what he learned as Robin while coming into his own as a respected member of the super hero pantheon. His code, like his mentor’s, is simple—if you’re breaking the law on his turf, watch out. Anyone who doesn’t can expect a short and most assuredly painful trip to Arkham.</p><p>Yet, while he may share methods and motivation with Batman, Dick knows what being Batman can do. He doesn’t want to become as dark, controlling and lonely as Bruce. But for all the good he’s accomplished while avoiding it, one question is unavoidable—without going as far as Batman, can Nightwing be as effective as he ultimately wants to be?</p>",

But in death, he became one of its greatest heroes. Brand performed as a trapeze artist using the stage name \"Deadman\" due to his death-defying acts, ghostly white face paint and flamboyant costume. But during one of his performances, he was murdered in midair by a mysterious assassin known only as \"The Hook.\" When he died, his spirit was granted the power to possess any living being by the Hindu god Rama Kushna, so that Boston could search for his killer and receive a measure of peace. Now a literal Deadman, he was both a ghost and a DC superhero.</p><p>Although Deadman would eventually catch his murderer, who'd killed him as part of an elaborate initiation ritual to join an elite group of assassins, he continued to use his abilities to help people in the mortal world. While the majority of Earth's heroes don't know about Brand's existence as Deadman, there are a select few who do. He's worked several times with Batman, as well as more supernaturally inclined heroes like the Spectre and the Sentinels of Magic. In more recent years, he's served as a member of the Justice League Dark.

It wasn't until then new recruit Hal Jordan learned of Sinestro's methods that the Guardians were informed and Sinestro was ejected from the Corps.</p><p>Steadfast in his belief of moral superiority and methods of maintaining order, Sinestro formed the Sinestro Corps, harnessing the yellow energy of fear, to not only combat the Guardians, whom he sees as the main obstacle on the path to intergalactic peace, but to also strengthen the Green Lantern Corps. For it is Sinestro’s opinion that the Green Lanterns have long since been held back by their creators.</p><p>Highly intelligent with an almost unbreakable will, Thaal Sinestro will do anything to achieve control and thereby order—control over his emotions, control over others, and even control over the entire universe.</p>",

The tragic result of a bizarre science experiment gone horribly wrong, Bizarro is an imperfect duplicate of Kal-El, with none of his intelligence or self-control. Looking like a pasty white, zombie-like version of the Last Son of Krypton, he invariably strikes fear into those he encounters. Often a creature more to be pitied than feared, Bizarro nevertheless is as dangerous as it gets...whether he means to be lethal or not.</p><p>There have been many versions of Bizarro over the years, some created by science and some by magical means, but he has been a persistent thorn in the side of Superman since the earliest days of the Silver Age. Usually wanting nothing more than to be seen as the hero that his famous counterpart Superman is, he has often developed a strong hatred for his \"perfect\" brother. Sometimes misguided, sometimes genuinely malevolent, and even sometimes a true hero himself, Bizarro is nevertheless a force to be reckoned with.</p><p><br /><em><strong>For more on Bizarro's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/mythos/bizarro/\" target=\"_blank\">visit his page on DCUniverse.com.</a></strong></em></p>",

However, as he learned more about the Flash, Eobard discovered how his own life was linked to his hero’s: He was destined to become one of Barry Allen’s greatest villains, a revelation that led Eobard to grow unhinged. When he eventually replicated the chemical accident that granted the Flash super speed, Eobard took on a new identity—that of the Reverse-Flash, a wicked subversion of everything the Flash stands for.</p><p>Granted with powers and abilities similar to that of the Flash, the Reverse-Flash is unwavering in his determination to oppose and destroy all that’s important to the Flash. His ability to travel through time allows him to attack the Flash at almost any point throughout history. However, he is unable to ever kill the Flash—for the Reverse-Flash would not exist if he killed his own inspiration.

A promising psychologist and intern at Arkham Asylum in Gotham City, Harleen was given the chance to get up close and personal with the Joker, an experience that wound up ending…badly. Harleen became obsessed with her subject, and after falling madly in love with the Clown Prince of Crime, she helped him escape the asylum.</p><p>Her love for the Joker inspired Harleen to adopt a new identity, that of Harley Quinn, The Joker’s sidekick-slash-love interest—whether he wanted one or not.

She became an entrepreneur and a member of several slightly less-than-reputable super teams (including the Suicide Squad), Gotham City’s all-girl gang (the Gotham City Sirens) and a traveling sideshow. Along the way Harley has become one of the most popular super-villains in the DC Universe, thanks in part to her versatility, charisma and cheery-but-deranged outlook on life.</p><p>After all, as Harley would say, if you're going to go a little crazy, you may as well sit back and enjoy the ride!</p><p><br /><em><strong>For more on Harley Quinn's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/harley-quinn/\" target=\"_blank\">visit her page on DCUniverse.com.</a></strong></em></p>",

      "description": "<p>Able to take the form of almost any animal, Garfield Logan, despite his flippant personality, is one of the most esteemed superheroes to bear the name “Titan.”</p><p>It’s not easy being green, but Garfield “Gar” Logan certainly makes the best of it. After contracting a rare disease as a child, Gar’s parents were forced to administer an experimental genetic treatment involving the DNA of animals with known resistances to the disease as a potential cure.</p><p>The good news: their experiment worked. The bad news: it had some pretty dramatic side effects. It turned Gar’s skin, hair and eyes a bright green color and gave him the incredible ability to shapeshift into any animal at will…with just one important caveat. Any form Gar happens to take will also be completely green, no matter what. So much for being able to blend in.</p><p>Luckily, fading into the background has never been Gar’s goal in life. When he’s not using his powers to be a superhero, he spends his time as an amateur actor and social butterfly, winning friends and “adoring fans” (at least, in his head) wherever he goes. He’s quick with a joke and quicker with a smile, and remains upbeat, optimistic and flirtatious even through the worst of times, making him a valuable asset for the morale of any team he might find himself a part of.</p><p><br /><em><strong>For more on Beast Boy's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/beast-boy/\" target=\"_blank\">visit his page on DCUniverse.com.</a></strong></em></p>",

Largely uneventful, and when problems did arise, they were handled easily by the world’s large population of super heroes. Until a day finally arrived like no other, and Earth-8’s strongest heroes were forced to unite against a common threat. The Retaliators were born!</p><p>Not quite what you were expecting? Perhaps that’s the best way to describe this world, populated with heroes such as the patriotic power soldier known as American Crusader, the lightning-charged warrior god Wundajin, the massively-morphing, quick to anger monster known as the Behemoth and the scientifically-minded, elementally-powered foursome known as the Future Family. Alongside such figures as Machinehead, Ladybug, Stuntmaster and the “neo-human” heroes of the G-Men, they keep their world safe from threats like the destructive Lord Havok and the Extremists.</p><p>On Earth-8, a life of heroism often comes at great sacrifice to the man or woman behind the mask. Faith in heroes is in short supply and mistrust can run rampant. Perhaps the people of Earth-8 should talk to some of their alternate world counterparts, who turn out in droves for movies featuring the very heroes they’re shunning.</p>",

While this habit constantly leads to the aptly named Riddler failing in his criminal endeavors, his puzzle-problem actually stems not only from his own narcissism and ego, but also from a deep-seeded psychological compulsion. Because of this, the Riddler often finds himself a resident of Arkham Asylum following his inevitable capture.</p><p>Possessing a genius-level intellect, the Riddler creates elaborate, sometimes Rube Goldberg-esque traps, and is even willing to use innocent civilians as bait. Although not physically imposing, the Riddler's brilliance, neurosis and lack of empathy make him an incredibly dangerous foe. He cares very little—if at all—about the lives of those he uses in his plots and instead only sees them as disposable pawns in his continuing intellectual battle against Batman.</p>",

Maybe it’s his other name that strikes fear into the hearts of citizens both good and bad: The Penguin.</p><p>This is a villain fueled by a pathological rage that compels him to turn his odd physique, bird-like profile and awkward waddle into a well-dressed force for fear. No one knows more about what the evil forces of Gotham are up to at any given moment than he and he uses that information to blackmail, intimidate and corrupt anyone he can, especially when it’s in the service of bringing down Batman.</p><p>They say you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, but they also say evil is as evil does. A master manipulator, the Penguin is usually surrounded by violent henchmen who do his bidding without question. But when it comes down to a face-to-face, expect him to unleash a deadly barrage from a variety of umbrella weapons and other ingenious devices—often taking the form of fowl. And when all else fails, the Penguin will fight as dirty as they come, hand to hand combat doesn’t ruffle his feathers at all.</p>",

So imagine what might happen if we were to flip the message. If we were to teach our children that evil was the way of the world. If teachers and philosophers taught their students to “do no good” rather than to “do no harm.” If the world leaders and heroes of our planet sought to maintain chaos and corruption rather than peace.</p><p>Our world would be starkly different. It would be a nightmare. It would be a place of death and devastation. It would be Earth-3.</p><p>A complete opposite of Earth-0 in every way, good and evil are reversed in the ruthless nations of Earth-3. Greed, ambition and conquest are rewarded, especially when they come at the expense of others. Heroes have no place in a world like this, and so it’s a collective of villains that seek to prolong and foster their Earth’s way of life: Ultraman, Superwoman, Owlman, Power Ring, Johnny Quick, the Sea King, Atomica and Grid. Or as they’re better known, the Crime Syndicate.</p><p>Yet in a world where destruction is celebrated, how long will it be until all is eliminated and existence itself is wiped out? For Earth-3, that day finally arrived as the entire world was eliminated by an even larger instrument of devastation—the Anti-Monitor. Now, only a few members of the Crime Syndicate remain after fleeing from their Earth to ours. One could view it as poetic justice… if Earth-3 cared about poetry.</p>",

In fact, one could say that it’s almost as if each one was dreamt up by a different individual to represent their image of an ideal super hero.</p><p>How else to explain how the gruff, blue collar Dino-Cop’s workaday approach to preserving the peace could come to coexist alongside the bleak, otherworldly operations of Spore, Earth-41’s “necro floral” avenger? Along with the Nimrod Squad—made up of hard-light archer Fletch, the stone-with-a-soul Flintstein, actress-turned-hero Vague and more—they protect their people and their planet from threats that are almost as varied as they are, occupying a somewhat eclectic, but still unified corner of the Multiverse.</p>",

Whether it was in search of justice, thrills or revenge, in the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century a number of remarkable men and women with no powers to speak of other than resourcefulness, intelligence and various levels of combat training donned costumes and took to the streets, fighting to keep the peace and protect their fellow law abiding citizens. Whether it was the technology-driven Blue Beetle, the beautiful-but-dangerous Nightshade, the patriotic, state-sponsored Peacemaker or the violent, unsanctioned Question, they fought villains using little more than their fists.</p><p>Then everything changed. When Captain Allen Adam came into close contact with the unstable element known as U-235, it altered him forever, changing his appearance and endowing him with powerful “quantum senses” capable of manipulating the very fabric of reality. The world’s first—and only—super-powered hero was born.</p><p>Yet rather than rendering Earth-4’s human heroes irrelevant, the newly minted Captain Atom gave them a powerful rallying point. Joining alongside the blue-hued superman, they formed the Pax Americana, a peacekeeping group of uninformed agents united to keep the streets, and their nation’s interests, secure from threats within their borders and beyond.</p>",

In this world, Superman first appeared to the public in 1938, and Batman followed one year later in 1939. From that point on, Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne proceeded to age normally, growing old and eventually leaving the super heroics to their sons, daughters and grandchildren.</p><p>Modern citizens of Earth-38 are familiar with a whole dynasty of heroes following in the footsteps of the original Batman and Superman. This includes Kara Kent, the daughter of Clark Kent and Lois Lane, who would go on to develop her own super powers and fight injustice as Supergirl. The title of Batman, taken on after Bruce Wayne’s retirement by the original Robin, Dick Grayson, is eventually passed down to Wayne’s son, Bruce Wayne, Jr. Even later, the grandson of Superman and Batman—Clark Wayne—develops a futuristic superhero identity: Knightwing.</p><p>All of these heroes and more—including the offspring of other members of the Justice League—continue to fight evil down through the generations, though there is one determined enemy that none of them seem capable of opposing: Time itself.</p>",

After Bruce Wayne succumbed fully to the dark curse, the world of Earth-43 was plunged into a full-scale bloodsucker outbreak, watching as its greatest heroes succumbed to the scourge.</p><p>The once-noble Justice League transformed into the twisted Blood League, losing all traces of its humanity. The League’s membership includes nearly unrecognizable vampiric variations of Batman, Ultraman, Green Lantern and others. They’re powerful and endlessly thirsty. In fact, the only hope for anyone they’ve chosen to target may be that their undead state has brought with it new weaknesses. Vampire Green Lantern cannot withstand contact with yellow sunlight, while Vampire Ultraman must avoid red sunlight at all costs.</p><p>So greedy is the terrifying Blood League for fresh corpses, they have waged an ongoing campaign against the planet Rann, home base of the interplanetary hero Adam Strange. The discovery of alternate universes, chock full of potential new victims, would certainly capture the League’s attention.</p>",

The people of this planet were left vulnerable—an irresistible temptation to the malevolent forces found within the Multiverse. Enter the lonely, bipolar Dr. Will Tornado, a mechanical genius with a vision. Tornado focused his efforts on engineering his own super heroes from the ground up, and decided to base them on the comic books he had read and cherished as a kid. The results are a Justice League as powerful as all the others—only robots. And like the Metal Men of other worlds, each hero is forged of a different mineral, adapting many of its qualities.</p><p>Gold—this world's reflection of Superman—serves as the team’s leader. The Earth-44 Batman is a robotic Dark Knight suit of Iron. Wonder Woman is made of Platinum, while the Flash’s role is embodied in Earth-44's speedster, Mercury. Tornado appropriately chose Nth Metal from which to construct Earth-44's Hawkman, inspired by his counterpart’s native planet, Thanagar. Elongated Man is here composed of Tin, giving him that much-needed malleable quality, while the slow and bulky Lead recalls the Justice League's Green Arrow.</p><p>Together, they keep the people of their planet safe, a truly shining example of justice, heroism and teamwork.</p>",

The problem was that the only way to realize a project on the scale of this reality-bending device was to get financial backing from the greedy Overcorp, which proceeded to use the machine to create the evil entity known as “Superdoomsday.” (Think Doomsday plus Superman, but backed by the world’s biggest corporation.) Superdoomsday proceeded to wreak havoc across the Multiverse before his eventual defeat at the combined hands of the Supermen from Earth-0 and Earth-23.</p><p>Nevertheless, the creation of Superdoomsday was devastating for Earth-45, as the entire planet gradually succumbed to the allure of corporate control, eventually devolving into a fascist reflection of the will of Overcorp and Superdoomsday himself. Today, the Superdoomsday logo and likeness cover just about every available surface on the planet.</p>",

In it, we’ve dreamed of super men who could fly, billionaires who fight crime and Amazon warriors who wield truth-bringing lassos—heroes who have filled up a whole Multiverse of worlds. So when that Multiverse is in danger, it only makes sense that we dream up one more: Ultra Comics, a super hero who exists on Earth-33 the only way he can, in the form of the very medium that birthed them.

Before her career as a musician took off, she spent most of her time just trying to survive on the streets of Gotham City. It was this rough upbringing that taught her the value of her strength and gave her the skills to fight—something that would later prove a huge asset as she put on a mask and became a superhero.</p><p>Dinah spends her time working both solo and on various teams. Most notably, she helps with the Birds of Prey alongside her best friend and fellow hero, Barbara Gordon. But when she's not fighting for the betterment of Gotham, chances are you can find her roaming Seattle alongside the on-again-off-again love of her life, Green Arrow.</p><p><br /><em><strong>For more on Black Canary's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/mythos/black-canary/\" target=\"_blank\">visit her page on DCUniverse.com.</a></strong></em></p>",

He just knows that in this city, sometimes to solve a crime you need to cross the line. Whether it’s taking a bribe, roughing up a perp or forging ties with organized crime, Bullock is more than willing to bend the rules to keep the people of Gotham safe and put the truly dangerous criminals behind bars.</p><p style=\"letter-spacing: 0.389999985694885px;\">Even though he may operate in a decidedly gray area, Bullock has righteous intentions. He's loyal to the job and Commissioner Gordon, and has a begrudging respect for Batman. Bullock's willingness to push the boundaries of ethics in favor of getting results to benefit the greater good has proven effective, but it's dangerous territory. He must exercise caution to ensure he doesn't go too far and lose his way. Otherwise, this cop, who has devoted his life to upholding the law, may just find himself on the wrong side of it.</p>",

Born some 13 billion years ago in the Antimatter Universe, the powerful entity conquered his universe and sought to destroy all the positive matter universes and expand his own dark realm.

Although willing to go after any super heroes, H.I.V.E. often finds itself at odds with the Teen Titans, and as such, has regularly worked alongside the team's greatest adversary, Slade Wilson, aka Deathstroke.</p>",

Instead, she lives up to her name with her awe-inspiring height and power as well as the impact she leaves on her enemies.</p><p>Taken from her mother at an early age, Barda grew up on Apokolips in Granny Goodness's \"Orphanage\" where she was trained in the art of battle. Barda relished fighting and enjoyed besting anyone that challenged her. Her sheer power and unparalleled skills in combat quickly made her the most feared Apokoliptian warrior of all time—an incredible feat to accomplish on a world that bred the most terrifying, cruel and malicious fighters in the Multiverse. Barda's abilities and take-charge attitude even allowed her to become the leader of the Female Furies, a ferocious and powerful group of warriors who served as the personal guard to Apokolips's tyrannical ruler, Darkseid. Barda served Darkseid for many years—until she met Mister Miracle. The two fell in love and Barda began questioning Darkseid’s cruelty and totalitarian philosophy. Eventually, she fled to Earth, battling her way through the hordes of Apokolips and her former allies—defeating them all.</p><p>Barda continues to share a close and romantic relationship with Mister Miracle, despite their contrasting personalities. Whereas Mister Miracle is more peaceful and kind, Barda loves to fight and relishes battle. She's the brawn to his brain, and as the more powerful of the two, tends to be very protective of him.</p><p>As a New God, Barda possesses immense levels of enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina and more. Barda is also a master of multiple forms of combat and an expert swordswoman, capable of fighting even Wonder Woman to a stand-still. Her height alone makes her one of the tallest and most intimidating heroes in the universe. Along with her physical capabilities, Barda wears Apokoliptian armor that enhances her impressive abilities and wields the Mega-Rod, which may look small but packs a punch that could level mountains. As a high-tech weapon, the Mega-Rod fires powerful concussive bolts, increases gravitational forces and allows Barda to instantaneously teleport herself and others great distances.</p>",

Their populations became known as the New Gods, the immortal denizens of the cosmos who existed outside the constraints of earthly time and space.</p><p>Things were far from peaceful for the New Gods of either planet, and soon they found themselves consumed by war. The ruler of New Genesis, Highfather, eventually brokered peace with the ruler of Apokolips, Darkseid, by orchestrating an exchange of their sons. Highfather's son, Scott Free, was given over to the torture pits of Apokolips, while Darkseid's son, Orion, was released to the relative luxury of New Genesis.</p><p>The treaty lasted for a time, but sadly, Darkseid's lust for power was not so easily sated. He used the respite of peace to bolster his forces and begin his hunt for the mythical Anti-Life Equation, a weapon that would give him the power not only to destroy New Genesis, but to bend all life in the universe to his will. And after Scott Free escaped Apokolips alongside former Female Fury Big Barda to make a new home on Earth, there was nothing keeping Darkseid from mobilizing yet again.</p><p>Now Highfather's forces, led by the fleet-footed Lightray and the rage-filled Orion, must clash with Apokolips’ Granny Goodness and her Female Furies, the relentless general Steppenwolf and his Parademons and the bloodthirsty Kalibak in a race to find the Anti-Life Equation before it falls into Darkseid's hands.</p>",

However, despite the brutality and violence inflicted upon him, his will never broke and he never gave up hope. He dreamed of escape. But to escape the unescapable, he would need a miracle—so he became Mister Miracle.</p><p>In order to stop the destructive and long-waged war between New Genesis and Apokolips, the benevolent Highfather agreed to a gesture of peace: he would exchange sons with Darkseid, effectively condemning his child to the hells of Apokolips. Darkseid turned Scott over to Granny Goodness's \"Orphanage,\" where he was subjected to countless horrors and torture in an effort to destroy the goodness inside him, but Scott refused to surrender his innocence. Never physically powerful, Scott instead began training his mind—mentally distancing himself from the pain and sharpening his reason, logic and problem-solving abilities—turning him into an unparalleled and cunning thinker. When he finally made his escape, he succeeded through brain and not brawn, leaving behind the terror of Apokolips for life on Earth as the super hero Mister Miracle.</p><p>Mister Miracle shares a close and romantic relationship with his fellow New God Big Barda. The two met on Apokolips and quickly fell in love, despite their contrasting personalities. While Barda loves to fight and relishes battle, Scott is more peaceful and kind and simply wants to fit in and lead a normal life, much to Barda's chagrin. Their contrasting personalities but deep love for one another gives them one of the most unique relationships in the DC Universe.</p><p>Like all New Gods, Mister Miracle possesses beyond superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina and more. Along with his natural gifts, Mister Miracle carries a number of weapons and advanced Apokoliptian technology, including a Mother Box that can transfer energy, sense danger and life, create force fields, project shock-waves and open boom tubes for travel. He also utilizes personally modified Aero Disks that allow him to fly at speeds of over 200 mph and cling to walls and ceilings.

Among his most trusted and close lieutenants was Freddy Freeman, a young man was became seriously injured during a battle between Captain Marvel and the evil Captain Nazi. When ordinary medical care could not save his life, Billy Batson shared a portion of his powers with Freddy in an effort to heal him. It did that and so much more. Now, whenever Freddy says the name of his idol Shazam out loud, he transforms into a superhero himself named Captain Marvel Jr.</p><p>Captain Marvel Jr. has all the same powers as the original Captain Marvel, but unlike Billy Batson, he remains his youthful self and doesn't transform into an adult when saying the magic words. Sadly, while in mortal form, Freddy would also remain crippled from the injuries sustained from being caught in the crossfire of the battle. Freddy served faithfully at the side of his mentor and his sister Mary for many years, and for a time he even replaced Billy Batson when he became the new Wizard at the Rock of Eternity. In the post-Flashpoint reality, Freddy Freeman is actually Billy Batson's foster brother, and goes by the name Shazam Jr., as part of a larger, extended Shazam family.</p><p><br /><em><strong>For more on Captain Marvel Jr.'s history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/captain-marvel-jr/\" target=\"_blank\">visit his page on DC Universe.com.</a></strong></em></p>",

It wasn't long after that the Wizard began extending his powers to other people in Batson's life, making them superheroes as well. Among the first were Billy's sister, Mary Bromfield, who became Mary Marvel, and young Freddy Freeman, who became Captain Marvel Jr. They were eventually joined by the \"Lieutenant Marvels\"—three other boys also named Billy Batson who were nicknamed \"Tall Billy,\" \"Fat Billy\" and \"Hill Billy.\" These three could also access the powers of Shazam when they shouted the magic word in unison. The Marvel Family even had a non-super-powered member in an old man they nicknamed Uncle Dudley, who wore a homemade costume, and Mr. Tawky Tawny and Hoppy the Marvel Bunny, anthropomorphic animals who were considered honorary members.</p><p>In the post-Flashpoint reality, the Marvel Family goes by the name \"the Shazam Family\" and are all the adopted siblings of Billy Batson, raised in foster care with him by Rosa and Victor Vasquez. Once Billy gained the powers of Shazam, he eventually discovered he could share those powers with members of his new family. Now, when his siblings Darla Dudley, Eugene Choi, Mary Bromfield, Pedro Peña, and Freddy Freeman say the magic word \"Shazam,\" they too become adult superheroes. Each member of this version of the Shazam Family shares their power equally with the others, so if the six members are transformed at once, each of them gets only a fraction of the power level.</p><p><br /><em><strong>For more on the Shazam Family's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/shazam-family/\" target=\"_blank\">visit their page on DCUniverse.com.</a></strong></em></p>",

One exception to this is Roman Sionis, the Black Mask.

Born to a life of wealth and privilege, Oliver Queen took it all for granted until tragedy struck at sea, leaving him alone on a deserted island. There, Queen had to dig deep to find out if he had the inner fortitude to survive. While stranded on this island, Oliver honed his already formidable archery skills into becoming the greatest archer ever known.</p><p>When he finally returned to civilization, he embarked on a career as an urban vigilante, attempting to rid the streets of his hometown of Seattle, and also Star City, from crime and corruption with nothing but a bow and arrow.

And second, for every “zombie” he ushers towards oblivion, a new accounting is made by the edge of that knife upon his own skin. Often depicted as completely hairless, the only way to tell who Zsasz is at a glance is by the dizzying number of tally marks on every inch of his skin. Each one, the death of a person whose only crime was breathing the same air as Victor Zsasz.</p>\n",

Perhaps the greatest bromance in the DC Universe is the one between photographer and former cub reporter Jimmy Olsen and the Man of Steel, and it goes way back to the earliest days of the Golden Age of comics. As much as Lois Lane is the love of Clark Kent’s life, and Daily Planet editor Perry White is a surrogate father figure, Jimmy Olsen is the kid brother Superman never had.</p>\n\n<p>Despite his outwardly youthful appearance, often shown wearing a bow tie and sporting freckles, James Olsen is a career journalist and photographer at the Daily Planet, and has been since his late teens, when he was an intern for Perry White. In most versions of his history, Olsen was present when Superman made his public debut and has been friends with both the Man of Steel and his alter ego Clark Kent ever since.</p>\n\n<p>Despite just being an ordinary guy, Jimmy Olsen is braver than most, and is always willing to put himself in real danger in order to get that elusive photo or get the scoop that’ll land him the story of the century. Almost always forthright and true, James Olsen always has his BFF Superman’s back, even if it’s Superman who winds up needing to watch Jimmy’s back most of the time.</p>\n\n<p><br /><em><strong>For more on Jimmy Olsen's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/jimmy-olsen/\" target=\"_blank\">visit his page on DCUniverse.com.</a></strong></em></p>\n",

In a city overrun with larger-than-life criminals, the always-laughing villain stands alone. A complete psychopath with no moral compass whatsoever, the Joker, whose real name and identity remain completely unknown, is characterized by his chalk-white skin, green hair and a permanent rictus grin stretched across his face. But there isn’t a single thing funny about this particular clown, who only finds humor in the suffering of others.</p>\n\n<p>The Joker first appeared in Gotham City around the same time that the Batman arrived on the scene, and since their very first confrontation, the Clown Prince of Crime has been the Dark Knight’s most formidable nemesis. While Batman represents justice and order, the Joker is his complete opposite, seeing himself as an agent of chaos, the living embodiment of the cruel randomness of fate. The Joker’s psychosis causes his personality to shift between goofy prankster and mass murderer on a dime, making it impossible to predict his next move. It’s this unpredictability that really makes him such a dangerous opponent.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, no villain has managed to inflict as much pain and suffering on Batman as the Joker, who has on more than one occasion brought death to Bruce Wayne’s extended family. As long as there is a Batman bringing justice to Gotham City, there will be a Joker to bring nightmares.</p>\n\n<p><br /><em><strong>For more on the Joker's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/joker/\" target=\"_blank\">visit his page on DCUniverse.com.</a></strong></em></p>\n",

Most are generally human. But one stands apart—the massive freak of nature known as Killer Croc. Born as Waylon Jones, Croc has a rare genetic condition which gives him a crocodilian appearance. Raised by an abusive aunt who mocked his deformity, he eventually ran away and joined the circus, becoming a sideshow carnival attraction, where patrons could come and gawk at the freakish strongman called \"Killer Croc.\" Croc eventually departed for Gotham City, where he began a life of crime—one which brought him into regular conflict with the Dark Knight.</p>\n\n<p>Although he began as just a man with crocodile-like skin, over the years, Killer Croc's appearance has grown more and more inhuman. Croc now has a more bestial form, complete with a truly reptilian head, razor sharp claws and teeth, and a tail. His animal nature has made him a formidable foe, but his limited intellect has kept him from ever truly achieving his true potential. Nevertheless, Croc’s brute strength and killer instincts have made him an ever-present thorn in Batman’s side, who must be ever vigilant in case the deadly Croc once again emerges from the sewers below to wreak havoc on Gotham City.</p>\n\n<p><br /><em><strong>For more on Killer Croc's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/killer-croc/\" target=\"_blank\">visit his page on DCUniverse.com.</a></strong></em></p>\n",

Unfortunately for Steve Trevor, that’s exactly how he came to be the first outsider to set foot on the Amazonian homeland of Themyscira.</p>\n\n<p>After being rescued from the wreckage by the princess Diana, Steve was put to the task of winning the trust of the Amazons—something much easier said than done, considering their complete isolation from the world outside their magical borders. But luckily for him, Diana was inspired by Steve’s bravery and compassion, enough to vouch for him against her sisters’ natural misgivings.</p>\n\n<p>Though he has no super powers or mythical weapons of his own, Steve’s strength and courage in the face of danger have proven him to be a consummate soldier and occasional spy, saving his squad and the nation more times than we can count. All the while, he’s been an invaluable ally for Diana, both in her civilian life and in her super heroic duties as Wonder Woman, serving as her entry point and frequent guide through the strange and unpredictable world of humankind…and, on occasion, much, much more.</p>\n",

She, along with several women, who were also reincarnated souls whose lives were cut short by man's hatred, formed the noble Amazon tribe in ancient times.

Blessed with powers from the gods themselves, it is unclear if Diana was created when Hippolyta crafted a child made of clay which was gifted with life, or if Diana was born from an affair between herself and Zeus, as there are conflicting accounts to Diana’s creation. Reluctantly, Queen Hippolyta allowed her daughter Diana to leave Themyscira and become Wonder Woman, a fact which has caused her constant worry.

Whenever the Amazon Princess needed a hand, Etta Candy and her “Holliday Girls” were always on the way to help with a “WOO!

He is Batman.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most iconic fictional characters in the world, Batman has dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a war on all criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was just a child. Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he's assembled teams of his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman, Incorporated.</p>\n\n<p>A playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne’s double life affords him the comfort of a life without financial worry, a loyal butler-turned-guardian and the perfect base of operations in the ancient network of caves beneath his family’s sprawling estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape and pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, skies and rooftops of Gotham City.</p>\n\n<p><br /><em><strong>For more on Batman's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/batman/\" target=\"_blank\">visit his page on DCUniverse.com</a></strong></em></p>\n",

Each of them redefined the word \"hero.\"</p>\n\n<p>The mysterious power known as the Speed Force is an energy field that has, over the centuries, granted incredible powers of velocity to certain heroes. The most famous of these is the Flash, also known as the Fastest Man Alive. Ever since the days of World War II, there has been a man clad in red who can run at impossible speeds, using his power to save lives and defend those who cannot defend themselves. All between the ticks of a second.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1940s, college student Jay Garrick acquired his super-speed abilities in a random lab accident and became the first DC Super Hero to go by the name the Flash. Years later, Jay was succeeded by police scientist Barry Allen, until Barry’s former kid partner Wally West took up the mantle at a time when Barry was considered dead. But, when Barry returned, he became the Flash once again. All three generations of speedsters have been cornerstone members of both the Justice Society and Justice League.</p>\n\n<p>The Flash has mastery over not just speed, but time itself, and he has often used his powers to travel though different eras and even into other dimensions. Although the Flash has not always been fast enough to outrun personal tragedy when it has come for him, he always does his best to prevent the same from happening to the people of Central City and Keystone City. In so doing, he's earned himself a spot among the greatest Super Heroes the DC Universe has ever known.</p>\n\n<p><br /><em><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">For more on the Flash's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/flash/\" target=\"_blank\">visit his page on DCUniverse.com.</a></span></em></p>\n",

He possessed powers not only of telepathy, but mind control, telekinesis, astral projection and psi energy (or ectokinesis) that he could use to create and animate constructs. Unfortunately, Cizko was a sadist who hated women and enjoyed terrifying and torturing people to further his research into the human mind…and sometimes simply for enjoyment.

As gifted and insightful as she was, she had to work ten times as hard as everyone else in the room to make half the progress.

So, when Wonder Woman arrived in man’s world with her gods-given gifts preaching the peace and harmony which had always been denied to Cale, the businesswoman took it as a personal offense.</p>\n\n<p>Cale would go on to launch Godwatch, which was founded for the purpose of locating Themyscira. But as Wonder Woman discovered, the reason was not to enhance Cale’s own power or influence, but out of desperation.

      "description": "<p>One of Wonder Woman's deadliest enemies, Giganta's size and shape-shifting abilities are rivaled only by her scientific genius.</p>\n\n<p>There are not a lot of villains in Wonder Woman's rogues gallery who are a match for the Amazing Amazon in a physical fight, but the woman called Giganta is one of them. In the Golden Age, Giganta was actually an artificially mutated ape, whom a scientist named Professor Zool transformed into a red-haired strongwoman of huge proportions. In the post-<em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> universe, Giganta was Dr. Doris Zeul, a scientist who was dying from a rare blood disease. She captured Wonder Woman and planned to put her own \"life-essence\" into Diana's body, but the process was interrupted by Wonder Girl and her consciousness instead ends up in a test animal gorilla named Giganta.</p>\n\n<p>While still inside of the gorilla's body, Dr. Zeul abducted a comatose circus strongwoman named Olga with metahuman size-changing abilities and successfully transferred her consciousness into Olga's body, leaving Olga's own mind stranded inside the gorilla. Keeping the name Giganta, she embarked on a career as a super-villain, fighting with Wonder Woman several times, both alone and with a variety of different villain teams. But Giganta has a tender side as well, and briefly enjoyed a romance with the Atom, Ryan Choi. Post-<em>Flashpoint</em>, Doris Zeul became a child who was often bullied and afflicted with a rare blood condition. She was cured by a scientific procedure which also gave her size-changing powers, a side effect of which was a far more limited intellect.</p>\n\n<p><br /><em><strong>For more on Giganta's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/giganta/\" target=\"_blank\">visit her page on DCUniverse.com.</a></strong></em></p>\n",

The first time was when he witnessed the death of his father, pilot Martin Jordan. The second was when, as an adult and trained pilot himself, he was summoned to the crashed wreckage of a spaceship belonging to an alien named Abin Sur. Abin explained that he was a member of the Green Lantern Corps, an organization of beings from across the cosmos, armed with power rings fueled by the green energy of all willpower in the universe. Upon his death, Abin entrusted his ring and duties as the Green Lantern of Earth’s space sector to Hal Jordan.</p>\n\n<p>Hal’s life as a Green Lantern has not been easy.

Just ask Jason Todd. As Batman’s second Robin, Jason died at the hands of the Joker when he was just a child. But he returned to life with the help of a Lazarus Pit and the literal warping of time and reality.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Jason’s resurrection was far from a pleasant one. Traumatized by his own violent end, Jason returned to the world unhinged and bent on revenge. Not only for himself, but for everyone caught in the crossfire of the endless catch-and-release cycle of Gotham City’s super-villain underworld. He trained himself to be a killer and a mercenary, and he took on a new identity and code name—the Red Hood—in order to strike his own brand of fear in Gotham’s criminals.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, Jason learned to deal with his rage in a way that didn’t rack up a body count and he made peace with Batman and his fellow superheroes. But the bad blood between him and his adoptive family is ever ready to paint their city red once more.</p>\n\n<p><br /><em><strong>For more on Red Hood's history, <a href=\"https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/red-hood/\" target=\"_blank\">visit his page on DCUniverse.com.</a></strong></em></p>\n",
